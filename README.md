## Personal Profile
I study Computer Science in the last year of university. I am passionate about IT. I am a team player and always aim for teamwork, code review, documentation, discussion whether it is a complex project or a project just for fun. Also, I like any events related to IT where I can discover something new and exchange my experience with people. My hobby is Hackathons, where I learned and still learn new professional and personal skills.

## Experience
Mainly my professional experience comes from 23 Hackathons where I developed front-end/back-end/mobile apps. Beside developing I did design and project management. But also contributed to some open source projects.  
Some of my highlights:

- **[rebble.io](http://rebble.io)**  
  I opened an issue with converting the *SVG static watch logo* into *real-time clock*. After approvement from admins, I edited some SVG paths of the logo and using JavaScript and CSS created an *Easter egg real-time watch*. The hardest part was understanding how SVG works.
- **[FAF Hackathon 2017](https://github.com/strdr4605/faf-hack-bot/commits?author=strdr4605)**  
  My team had to implement a bot that helps with managing your bank transactions. My task was to filter transactions by years/months and prepare data for *ChartJS* plotting. I wanted to learn functional programming in JS so I used *filters, maps and reduces* to write small, readable code.
- **Techsylvania Hackathon 2017**  
  We created a *treasure hunting like game* on mobile using Bluetooth Low Energy for location detection. I was responsible for nodejs TCP server that allows users to share location and info. I used socket.io and created the protocol for communication.
- **[JSHacks 2016](https://github.com/jshacks/challenge-debt-md/tree/master/debt-md-front-end)**  
  My team was aggregating a public gov API and my task was the website that displays *external debt of Moldova* in a friendly way. With the help of mentors, I created a small *VueJS* app with *flux architecture* that communicates with our backend. 
- **StartUp Weekend 2016**  
  My team created a web app that allows artists to generate PDF catalogs for their paintings. We used nodejs to create pdf from images that are upload on the site. Because I was more experienced than my teammates, I managed the development, taught some JS basics and helped in resolving bugs.
- **[saci.md](http://saci.md)**  
  I had to create a simple landing page about bags. I decided to use as many CSS tricks as I can. Also, I created my own grid using *flexbox*. The site has some parallax effect and a lot of CSS animations.

### Other experience
- `21.09.2018–PRESENT`  
  *Chief Legal Officer* at **FAF NGO**, Computer Science Students Organization.
- *Speaker* at **FAF Lectures** (technical presentations/workshops).
